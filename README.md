# ConvNeXT Image Classification Project
# Overview
This project involves the implementation of the ConvNeXT model for image classification tasks. ConvNeXT is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network that has shown impressive results in image recognition. This Jupyter notebook, Finetune_ConvNeXT_IMG_classification.ipynb, demonstrates the process of fine-tuning ConvNeXT on a specific image dataset.
